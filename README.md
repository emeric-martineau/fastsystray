# Fast SysTray

Fast SysTray is a small utility that is located in the task bar next to the time.

It allows you to quickly access all your drives, eject and close them, quit Windows more quickly (shut down, restart it, close its session), put your computer in standby or hibernation (hibernation), to trigger the screen saver and even to lock your session!

In addition, you can add your own shortcuts to the menu, thus avoiding going back to the desktop.

Fast SysTray extends the "Run" dialog box by allowing you to not record the command type and also allowing to clear the history, and allows you to take a screenshot.

Finally, the Fast SysTray menu can be called up by right clicking on the icon in the task bar but also by left clicking.

Indeed, a Windows bug which has still not been corrected when writing these lines (Windows XP SP1a) causes that when you click with the right button of the mouse, the processor goes up to 100%, thus making the computer "row". Fast SysTray is a utility that works under Windows 95, 98, Millennium Edition, NT 4, 2000, XP, 2003.

It only requires 1.30 MB of hard drive, sources included.

The program has come to an end. So I stop the development. You can go see my other projects.
